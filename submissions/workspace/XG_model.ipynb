    "# XGBoost Model Training for Production Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates how to train an XGBoost model on reservoir production data to predict oil, water, and gas production.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**:\n",
    "   - **`os` and `glob`**: Used to handle file paths and retrieve reservoir folders from the dataset.\n",
    "   - **`pandas`**: For data manipulation and loading datasets.\n",
    "   - **`xgboost`**: The XGBoost library is imported to build and train the model.\n",
    "   - **`train_test_split`**: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "   - **`mean_squared_error`, `mean_absolute_error`, `r2_score`**: Metrics to evaluate model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Training the XGBoost Model**:\n",
    "   - After data preprocessing and splitting the data into training and testing sets, the XGBoost model is trained to predict oil, water, and gas production using production and rock characteristic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**:\n",
    "   - After training, the model is evaluated using common regression metrics, such as:\n",
    "     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.\n",
    "     - **R² Score**: Evaluates how well the model fits the data.\n"

    "# Combining Status and Production Data for Multiple Reservoirs\n",
    "\n",
    "This code combines the status (rock characteristics) and production (day-by-day production) data from multiple reservoirs into two consolidated DataFrames for further model training or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initializing DataFrames**:\n",
    "   - Empty lists (`all_status_dfs` and `all_production_dfs`) are initialized to store the status and production DataFrames for each reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieving Reservoir Folders**:\n",
    "   - Using the `glob` module, the code retrieves paths to all reservoir folders from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loading and Processing Data**:\n",
    "   - For each reservoir:\n",
    "     - The paths to the `state.csv` (status data) and `production.csv` (production data) files are generated.\n",
    "     - Both datasets are loaded into DataFrames if the corresponding files exist.\n",
    "     - The production data is grouped by the `Date` column, and mean values are computed for each day.\n",
    "     - The `day` column is reset to start from 1 for each reservoir, representing sequential days.\n",
    "     - A `reservoir_id` column is added to both the status and production DataFrames to track the reservoir source.\n",
    "     - The `Date` column is dropped from the production data after processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Combining Data**:\n",
    "   - All individual status and production DataFrames are concatenated into two combined DataFrames (`combined_status_df` and `combined_production_df`).\n",
    "   - These combined DataFrames contain all the data from multiple reservoirs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Saving Data**:\n",
    "   - The combined DataFrames are saved to CSV files (`combined_state.csv` and `combined_production.csv`) for future use.\n"

    "   - The aggregation is done using the `agg()` function, which computes the mean of each column for each reservoir. The aggregated data is stored in `status_df_agg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merge Aggregated Status Data with Production Data**:\n",
    "   - The aggregated status data (`status_df_agg`) is merged with the production data (`production_df`) based on the `reservoir_id`.\n",
    "   - This merge is performed using a left join, ensuring that all rows from the production data are preserved, and relevant status data is added where available.\n",
